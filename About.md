# About ArtNaon

**ArtNaon** is an innovative and comprehensive application developed by a team of seven students from various universities, each bringing unique expertise and passion to the project. The team is strategically divided into three parts: three members specializing in Machine Learning, two in Cloud Computing, and two in Mobile Development. This interdisciplinary collaboration ensures that ArtNaon leverages the latest technological advancements to deliver an exceptional user experience.

## Our Mission
Our mission at ArtNaon is to break down the barriers that prevent people from fully appreciating and understanding art. We recognized a common obstacle: the lack of professional guidance for those who wish to delve into the world of painting. Many art enthusiasts struggle to comprehend the meaning, genre, and nuances of the artwork they encounter, which can be discouraging. To address this, we created ArtNaon, an application that uses cutting-edge image detection technology to help users recognize and understand the genre, style, and characteristics of paintings. Our goal is to democratize art appreciation, making it accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or expertise.

## How ArtNaon Works
ArtNaon utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms and image detection technology to analyze paintings and provide users with detailed explanations and examples of similar works. The process is simple and intuitive:
- **Capture an Image:** Users can use their device's camera to take a picture of a painting or upload an image from their gallery.
- **Analysis:** ArtNaon analyzes the image to identify its genre, style, and key characteristics.
- **Explanation:** The app provides a detailed explanation of the identified genre, along with examples of similar paintings and information about the artistic style.

This process helps users gain a deeper understanding of the artwork, allowing them to appreciate it not just for its aesthetic value but also for the emotions and thoughts conveyed by the artist.

## Features
ArtNaon offers a range of features designed to enhance the user experience and facilitate independent learning:

- **Genre Classification:** ArtNaon can identify and explain seven distinct genres: Abstract, Expressionism, Neoclassicism, Primitivism, Realism, Romanticism, and Symbolism. Each genre is accompanied by a detailed description and examples of famous works.
- **Camera Integration:** Users can capture images of paintings using their device's camera to get instant information and explanations.
- **Gallery Upload:** Users can also upload images from their gallery for classification, making it easy to analyze artworks they encounter in digital form.
- **User Profile:** ArtNaon offers customizable user profiles where users can upload profile pictures from their gallery and personalize their experience.
- **Search Functionality:** The app includes a powerful search feature that allows users to search for specific art genres, styles, or keywords within the app.
- **Language Support:** ArtNaon supports both Indonesian and English, making it accessible to a broader audience.
- **Switch Mode:** The app includes flexible modes for personalized user experiences, allowing users to switch between different viewing and interaction modes.

## Our Vision
At ArtNaon, we believe that art should be accessible to everyone. Our vision is to facilitate independent learning, minimize the risk of errors in art interpretation, and increase the overall understanding and appreciation of art in the community. We aim to provide a deeper art experience that goes beyond superficial aesthetics, encouraging users to explore the emotions, feelings, and thought processes behind each artwork.

We hope to bridge the gap between art enthusiasts and the rich, diverse world of painting, fostering a more profound appreciation and understanding of artistic expressions. By spreading art knowledge and making it more accessible, we aim to cultivate a culture of art appreciation that transcends barriers and brings people closer to the world of art.
